![Profile Image](images/profile/profile-image.png)

Hello, I'm [@rollsicecream](https://github.com/rollsicecream) ðŸ‘‹

I'm the developer and creator of [The Privacy DNS Chooser Script](https://github.com/rollsicecream/privacy-dns-chooser) for Linux, a simple CLI tool that helps you choose many privacy-respecting DNS providers like [Quad9](https://quad9.net), [NextDNS](https://nextdns.io) and [Mullvad DNS](https://mullvad.net/en/help/dns-over-https-and-dns-over-tls) (more coming soon!) I'm also a contributor to PrivacyGuides and Techlore. Furthermore, I'm a privacy advocate, enthusiast and a proud Mullvad VPN shill.
