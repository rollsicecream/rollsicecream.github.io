## Where to see/contact me?

Here are ways of contacting me.

### Techlore Discussions

I am a daily user on the Techlore Discussions forum. While this isn't meant to be an instant messaging service and mainly just a forum, you can contact me with the messaging or chat button when clicking on my profile preview.

### PrivacyGuides forum

I also have an account on the PrivacyGuides forum. Like I said for Techlore Discussions, this isn't an instant messaging service and mainly a forum. To message me on this forum, do the same steps for Techlore Discussions, as these 2 forums are based in [Discourse](https://discourse.org), an 100% open-source forum/discussion platform that anyone can self-host!

### Social media (Mastodon/X/etc.)

I don't have any social media so there's *currently* no way of contacting me from there. I don't even have plans of having them in the first place. Of course, I would use Mastodon instead of X/Twitter. 😄

### Signal

You **cannot** contact me from Signal for now, I already claimed my username but : 

- If I accept your conversation with me, it will show my real/IRL name which is not ideal for me
- Yes, I know I could create a second Signal account with another temporary number but that's also not really ideal for me as I don't want to manage 2 apps (Signal + Molly, which is another Signal client) as Signal also doesn't support multiple accounts on one phone (at least for now).

If that situation changes, then I would gladly share my username 😀

### SimpleX

Option not available at this time 🙁
