## Where to see/contact me?

Here are ways of contacting me.

### Techlore Discussions

I am a daily user on the Techlore Discussions forum. While this isn't meant to be an instant messaging service and mainly just a forum, you can contact me with the messaging or chat button when clicking on my profile preview.

--> My profile : [Techlore Discussions](https://discuss.techlore.tech/u/rollsicecream/summary)

### PrivacyGuides forum

I also have an account on the PrivacyGuides forum. Like I said for Techlore Discussions, this isn't an instant messaging service and mainly a forum. To message me on this forum, do the same steps for Techlore Discussions, as these 2 forums are based in [Discourse](https://discourse.org), an 100% open-source forum/discussion platform that anyone can self-host!
